    Once Labor Day comes and goes, it's easy to feel like we're officially in the autumn season. But, in truth, we still have a few more weeks of summer to go! The summer-to-fall middle ground can feel challenging for home cooks who aren't yet ready to bust out their slow cookers and casserole dishes, but who are also eager to enjoy some seasonal flavor shifts. These recipes all feature produce that's in-season in early September, along with cooking techniques and flavor profiles that pay homage to both summer and autumn.
